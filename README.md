## New Manager Death Spiral
### Michael Lopp - VP of Engineering @ Slack)
---

death spiral:

1. i can do it, i'm the boss
* you sign up for all the things
* you're now signing yourself up as well as your entire team
* failure mode: quality of work has decreased
* your job is no longer to get things done, it's to get things done at scale

2. i can do it all myself. i'm in control because i'm the boss
* no longer delegate
* death spiral - no longer building trust or delegation
* **your job** is to aggressively delegate
* opinions can become facts (this is where politics get created)

3. this is not me
* management is not a promotion
* ic track + management track are completely separate
* management is a career restart
* silicon valley companies have jumped into managmeent
* there is something different between leadership and management

* the death spiral is not real
* let others change your mind
* augment your obvious and non-obvious weaknesses with a diverse team
* ideas do not become great with agreement
* good ideas from disagreements and discourse
* delegate more than is comfortable
* management itself already has alot of angst to the title (comp, promos)
* show you deserve those responsibilities by building trust, overcommunicating, giving and receiving feedback
* being a manager means you're scrutinized in every way
* think about whether you are building or corroding trust with every action
* make sure you have great people managers because people are your most valuable resources

# climbing the mountain of leadership productivity
(jared jordan - sr management growth engineering @ evernote)

* survey the landscape
  * can you tell me the mission
    * what do you like or don't like the team
      * what does success look like

      # navigating difficult conversations
      (shivani sharma - senior engineering manager @ slack)
      ---
      * emotional intelligence
      * trust
      * figure out the way people enjoy receiving feedback
      * larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions
      * google's study showed that psychological safety is the biggest factor in building a successful team
      * lead by example - how you behave under pressure
      * "equanimity" - mental clamness and composrue in difficult siutations
      * talk less and listen more
      * breathing - releases cortisol in the system
      * difficult conversations:
        1. prepare - stating what happened and what was the effect.
          2. practice - manager, employee, silent observer
            3. deliver - avoid the sandwich feedback. comes off as ingenuine
              4. problem solve together on what the next steps are 
                5. retro
                * book: difficult conversations
                * when giving feedback, think of what your end goal is instead of doing the feedback sandiwch
                * if someone is talking in circles, tell them you want to help them and take a break

                # the inclusive leader: developing diverse teams
                (jill wetzler - director of engineering @lyft)
                ---
                * we must immediately grant trust to those we lead
                * we should assume we've not earned  trust as leaders
                * earn trust: safety, feedback, advocacy
                * know reports on a personal level
                * be culture aware - gender pronouns, religious patterns, stereotypes
                * giving feedback:
                  observation - factual, indisputable
                    impact - outcome as related to expectations
                      expectation - fair for their level
                        assistance - take an active role for their development
                        * check yourself for bias

                        different kinds of managers:
                        * the cloner - you can't expect everyone to learn the same way you do
                        * the decider - you can't decide things on people's behalf
                        * the buddy - reports need to trust their managers to give them their feedback
                        * the asshole
                        * the joker - people will believe everything you say
                        * the wolf-cryer

                        * you are a secondary school guidance counsellor
                        * 1:1 - what do you want to do in 5 years, 10 years...
                        * before you do a pip:
                          * is it measurable?
                            * is it too hard?
                              * is it too easy?
                              * peopled need feedback more than advice
                                * situation
                                  * behavior
                                    * impact
                                    * before giving a pip, give them a project
                                    * tell them you want to be able to delegate a project for them
                                    * project can't be trivial but can't be critical either
                                    * this might not be the right job for them but give them a project

                                    * no one tells them about pre-meetings when you're a new manager
                                    * what go you here isn't going to get you there
                                    * protip 1: build support before the meeting
                                    * protip 3: listen so they're heard
                                    * protip 4: trust your gut

                                    # triple the team size without losing control
